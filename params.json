{"name":"Flattr","body":"# The Flattr Ruby Gem [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/simon/flattr.png)](http://travis-ci.org/simon/flattr) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/simon/flattr.png)](https://gemnasium.com/simon/flattr)\r\n\r\nThis gem is a wrapper around the Flattr API. With the gem you can search things, add new thing and much more. If you want information about updates follow [@simongate](http://twitter.com/simongate) on twitter.\r\n\r\n[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=smgt&url=https://github.com/simon/flattr&title=Flattr API gem&language=en_GB&tags=github&category=software)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstallation is easy, just install the gem with.\r\n\r\n`gem install flattr`\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n  * [Faraday](https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday)\r\n  * [multi_json](https://github.com/intridea/multi_json)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo talk with all of Flattr API resources you need to [register a application](http://flattr.com/apps). This will give you a `client id` and a `client secret` whom you can exchange for a `access token`. The `access token` is then used to access the resources in the Flattr API that needs authentication. You can find more information about the API in [Flattr developer documents](http://developers.flattr.net/api).\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nYou can find documentation about available resources in the code.\r\n\r\n* [flattrs](https://github.com/simon/flattr/blob/master/lib/flattr/client/flattrs.rb)\r\n* [things](https://github.com/simon/flattr/blob/master/lib/flattr/client/things.rb)\r\n* [users](https://github.com/simon/flattr/blob/master/lib/flattr/client/users.rb)\r\n* [categories](https://github.com/simon/flattr/blob/master/lib/flattr/client/categories.rb)\r\n* [languages](https://github.com/simon/flattr/blob/master/lib/flattr/client/languages.rb)\r\n\r\n### Access public resources\r\n\r\nThere are several public available resources in the Flattr API where you don't need to authenticate to access.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Fetch a public thing\r\nflattr = Flattr.new\r\n\r\nflattr.thing 423405\r\n# => #<Flattr::Thing:0x007fccbb4f1d40 @attrs={\"type\"=>\"thing\", \"resource\"=>\"https://api.flattr.com/rest/v2/things/423405\", \"link\"=>\"https://flattr.com/thing/423405\", \"id\"=>423405, \"url\"=>\"http://blog.flattr.net/2011/10/api-v2-beta-out-whats-changed/\", \"language\"=>\"en_GB\", \"category\"=>\"text\", \"owner\"=>{\"type\"=>\"user\", \"resource\"=>\"https://api.flattr.com/rest/v2/users/flattr\", \"link\"=>\"https://flattr.com/profile/flattr\", \"username\"=>\"flattr\"}, \"hidden\"=>false, \"created_at\"=>1319704532, \"tags\"=>[\"api\"], \"flattrs\"=>9, \"description\"=>\"We have been working hard to deliver a great experience for developers and tried to build a good foundation for easily add new features. The API will remain in beta for a while for us to kill quirks and refine some of the resources, this means there might be big changes without notice for ...\", \"title\"=>\"API v2 beta out – what’s changed?\"}>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Access protected resources\r\n\r\nThe gem allows makes it easy to do the oauth2 dance.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nFlattr.configure do |config|\r\n  config.client_id = '1234'\r\n  config.client_secret = '4567'\r\nend\r\n\r\nflattr = Flattr.new\r\n\r\nputs 'Open this URL in your browser to authenticate your application'\r\nputs flattr.authorize_url\r\n\r\nputs \"\\n\\n\"\r\n\r\nputs 'When your with the authentication the browser will redirect you to the callback URL you specified when creating a application. It has also included a code in the query string. Copy paste this code to the command line.'\r\nprint 'code: '\r\ncode = gets\r\n\r\n# Use the code and exchange it for a access_token\r\naccess_token = flattr.get_access_token code\r\n\r\nputs access_token\r\n\r\n# You are now authorized! ;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scopes available\r\n\r\nIf you request a access token without any scopes you won't be able to flattr other users things and such. The scopes available are:\r\n\r\n* `thing` - Create and update things\r\n* `flattr` - Flattr things\r\n* `extendedread` - Access all the information about users\r\n\r\n## What needs to be done\r\n\r\n* Add all the Flattr API resources\r\n* More tests are needed, coverage isn't that good\r\n\r\n## Supported Ruby Versions\r\n\r\nThis library aims to support and is [tested against](http://travis-ci.org/simon/flattr) the following Ruby implementations:\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.8.7\r\n* Ruby 1.9.2\r\n* Ruby 1.9.3\r\n* JRuby\r\n* Rubinius\r\n* Ruby Enterprise Edition\r\n\r\nIf something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered a bug.\r\n\r\nThis library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Simon Gate, Joel Hansson.
